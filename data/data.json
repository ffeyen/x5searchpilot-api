            "description": "&ldquo;Getting an education at MIT is like trying to drink from a firehose.&rdquo; &mdash; folk saying&nbsp;The Torch or The Firehose: A Guide to Section Teaching, by MIT Mathematics Professor Arthur Mattuck, is a guide to recitation teaching at MIT. During a typical recitation section, a teaching assistant (TA) meets with a small group of students to review the most recent lecture, expand on the concepts, work through practice problems, and conduct a discussion with the students. With good humor and sound advice, Professor Mattuck offers both novice and seasoned recitation instructors guidelines on how sections can best serve as a complement to lectures, how to help students become better learners, and how to enjoy their experience as recitation teachers. Lecturers claim they have learned something from it, too. This content was first published as a printed booklet in 1981. This is the second edition. It has had a wide distribution, both at MIT and other universities, since it first appeared. It is finally available in digital format to allow broader distribution and use of this valuable material. If any significant changes are required to adapt it to the needs of another institution, please clearly notify readers that the work is modified from the orginal version and provide a link to this web site.

            "description": "In 2011, Stanford University offered three online courses, which anyone in the world could enroll in and take for free. Together, these three courses had enrollments of around 350,000 students, making this one of the largest experiments in online education ever performed. Since the beginning of 2012, we have transitioned this effort into a new venture, Coursera, a social entrepreneurship company whose mission is to make high-quality education accessible to everyone by allowing the best universities to offer courses to everyone around the world, for free. Coursera classes provide a real course experience to students, including video content, interactive exercises with meaningful feedback, using both auto-grading and peer-grading, and a rich peer-to-peer interaction around the course materials. Currently, Coursera has 62 university partners, and over 3 million students enrolled in its over 300 courses. These courses span a range of topics including computer science, business, medicine, science, humanities, social sciences, and more. In this talk, I’ll report on this far-reaching experiment in education, and why we believe this model can provide both an improved classroom experience for our on-campus students, via a flipped classroom model, as well as a meaningful learning experience for the millions of students around the world who would otherwise never have access to education of this quality.",

        "description": "In her final lecture of the course, Professor Hungerford evaluates Jonathan Safran Foer's Everything is Illuminated with respect to one of her areas of expertise, American writing about the Holocaust. She points out how the novel takes on some of the questions of trauma theory in its examination of both the pain and the healing power of repetition. The most innovative characteristic of Foer's novel is, for Hungerford, the way it addresses the inheritance of the Holocaust for third-generation Jews in America. The novel finds new ways to provide witness for and connection to their grandparents' experiences in Europe, but also displaces a traditional Holocaust discovery narrative from the Jewish child of survivors to the Eastern European grandchild of those complicit in the destruction of shtetl life. **Reading assignment:** Jonathan Safran Foer, Everything is Illuminated (2002)",

She shows how Foer borrows and adapts themes and styles from other authors on the syllabus in service to his ambition as a writer to demonstrate the power of narrative fiction to address the great historical traumas of our time. In thus attempting to marry the nineteenth-century social novel with Postmodernist, or late Modernist, techniques, Foer participates in an emerging tradition that risks the confusion between resonant emotion and sentimental cliché.\r\n\r\n**Reading assignment:**\r\n\r\nJonathan Safran Foer, Everything is Illuminated (2002)",

This leads to related questions: who is a knower, and what can be known? Highlighting several different versions of how knowledge of the past is communicated through storytelling within the novel, she draws distinctions between Jones's model of historical knowledge and that of other writers on the syllabus. Professor Hungerford suggests that Jones revives a nineteenth-century form of the novel when his narrator takes on a God-like omniscience, but unlike the nineteenth-century novel's narrators, Jones's omniscient narrator provides little in the way of God-like consolation.\r\n\r\n**Reading assignment:**\r\n\r\nEdward P.

Referring to examples throughout the syllabus, but especially Maxine Hong Kingston's Woman Warrior, Hungerford describes the overriding tendency of American novels written after 1945 to explore the tension between individual and collective identities and to interrogate the artistic and political stakes of competing notions of authenticity.\r\n\r\n**Reading assignment:**\r\n\r\nMaxine Hong Kingston, The Woman Warrior (1976)",

For all of her power to recuperate the voices of the oppressed, the novelist must be wary of the ways that breaking the silence, too, can constitute an act of invasion. As in the case of Pynchon, the word in The Bluest Eye enacts a near-physical touch; this is its pleasure and its danger. With inimitable complexity and grace, Morrison weaves her narrative around a young black girl who, in the void of her social persona, constructs a beautiful and poisonous fiction.\r\n\r\n**Reading assignment:**\r\n\r\nToni Morrison, The Bluest Eye (1970)",

            "description": "There is a fundamental tension in cognitive development. Young children have severe limitations in planning, decision-making, executive function and attentional focus, roughly those abilities that involve prefrontal  control. Yet  young children are also prodigious learners, constructing everyday theories  of  the physical and psychological world with remarkable accuracy. I will suggest that children’s limitations in decision-making may actually be responsible in part for their superior learning. The argument is similar to that involving “explore/exploit” trade-offs in the course of reinforcement learning.  The skills involved in swift efficient decision-making are in tension with those involved in constructing generally accurate models of the world — although those models are essential for forming the right decisions.  I will describe several empirical studies showing that younger learners are better at inferring unusual or unlikely causal hypotheses than older learners, and will suggest that this reflects both the fact that they are less biased by prior knowledge and that they search hypothesis spaces more widely and creatively. The distinctive long immaturity of human children may reflect an evolutionary strategy in which a protected period allowing wide exploration and learning precedes the necessity for accurate decision-making.",

            "description": "Using a generally applicable dynamic structural system of equations, we give natural definitions of direct and total structural causality applicable to both structural VARs and recursive structures representing time-series natural experiments. These concepts enable us to forge a previously missing link between Granger (G-) causality and structural causality by showing that, given a corresponding conditional form of exogeneity, G- causality holds if and only if a corresponding form of structural causality holds. Of importance for applications is the structural characterization of finite-order G-causality, which forms the basisfor most empirical work. We show that conditional exogeneity is necessary for valid structural inference and prove that in the absence of structural causality, conditional exogeneity is equivalent to G non-causality. We provide practical new G-causality and conditional exogeneity tests and describe their use in testing for structural causality.",

Here we focused on the Granger causality approach in both the time and frequency domains in local and global networks, and applied our approach to experimental data (genes and proteins). For a small gene network, Granger causality outperformed all the other three approaches mentioned above. A global protein network from 812 proteins was reconstructed, using a novel approach. The obtained results fitted well with known experimental findings and opened up many experimentally testable predictions. In addition to interactions in the time domain, interactions in the frequency domain were also recovered. Our approach is general and can be easily applied to other types of temporal data.",

In this talk, I will review the theoretical foundations of each of these methods, describe their inherent assumptions, and discuss the resulting consequences for the analysis and interpretation of neuroimaging data.",

            "description": "The opening of The Ray and Maria Stata Center, MIT’s latest innovative building, inspires this panel’s historical review of collegiate architecture projects. James Ackerman provides the longest lens, focusing first on the earliest, national trends, when buildings served as both residences and classrooms. In the 18th century, Thomas Jefferson housed different disciplines in different pavilions. The Gothic style came next, cloisters and all, to promote “monkish learning closed from the community.” Signature buildings started popping up in the late 19th and 20th centuries, driven by “the patron demanding distinction rather than blending in.” Kimberly Alexander notes that throughout MIT’s history, its architecture has always embodied the institute’s mission. On its original Boston campus, the Rogers Building housed the first instructional physics laboratory. Students of this land-grant college were treated to European teachers and their vision. When MIT landed in Cambridge, its classical buildings “embraced new technologies” such as poured concrete and factory sash windows. After World War 2, the campus welcomed projects by international stars Eero Saarinen, Alvar Aalto and I.M. Pei (‘40 MIT) to embrace all aspects of community life. Charles Vest describes both the difficulties involved in completing the Stata Center, and the opportunity he saw “to create things of historical importance in the development of MIT”-- buildings that would somehow reflect not just academics and research, but the community itself.",

            "description": "In her opening address for Technology Day, MIT President Susan Hockfield lays out MIT’s ambitious agenda for addressing energy and the environment, and for transforming society’s approach to human health and disease.\r\n\r\nHockfield describes MIT’s new Energy Research Council, which will attempt “to produce transformational advances” not just in technologies but in policy. Some promising areas of research have already begun: new battery designs that will dramatically improve energy storage; and new types of photovoltaics, which “may make renewable energy cost competitive with fossil fuels without subsidies.”\r\n\r\nJust as MIT’s Radiation Lab of the 1940s helped launch the electronics revolution, so Hockfield hopes MIT’s efforts to meld life sciences and engineering will bring about a comparable revolution in medicine and health. She describes a “great circle” of research labs forming a “cauldron of collaboration” on campus.\r\n\r\nWhile MIT has an established record of excellence, warns Woodie Flowers in his address, it must “face the brutal facts.” The world has changed, and engineers can no longer follow the same path in education and training. He points to some recent studies that show MIT graduates don’t see much connection between their studies and the work they do in the world.\r\n\r\n“Learning differential equations is training; learning to think using the insights from differential equations is education – they are profoundly different,” Flowers says. He recommends a new tack at MIT: a shift away from big classes where “we pretend students learn what we say,” to “active learning.” He suggests creating a Draper Labs of Learning. “Make choices—pick biology, electro-mechanical, energy, and get the best people on the planet involved,” Flowers continues. “Do world-class stuff to compete with movies.”\r\n\r\nEstablish more internships, and develop lifelong symbiotic connections with alumni. Enable students to “encounter structured ways to learn new things,” and give them opportunities to tackle big problems, especially in another part of the world. Focus on creativity and synthesis rather than analysis, says Flowers, and emphasize leadership and team participation. “We have an ethical obligation to focus on what we do with them to help them have a comparative advantage,” he concludes.\r\n\r\n;**Link to** - **[[http://mitworld.mit.edu/video/373|Lecture´s Homepage]]**\r\n;**Host** - **[[http://alum.mit.edu/|MIT Alumni Association]]**\r\n;**Series** - **[[http://mitworld.mit.edu/series/view/96|MIT World Series: Technology Day 2006]]**",

            "description": "For many years, Cambridge, MA, as host to two major research universities, has been the scene of debates as to how best to meet the competing expectations of different stakeholders. Where there has been success, it has frequently been the result, at least in part, of inventive urban design proposals and the design and implementation of new institutional arrangements to accomplish those proposals. Where there has been failure it has often been explained by the inability - or unwillingness - of one stakeholder to accept and accommodate the expectations of another. The two most recent fall Urban Design Studios have examined these issues at a larger scale. In 2001 we looked at the possible patterns for growth and change in Cambridge, UK, as triggered by the plans of Cambridge University. And in 2002 we looked at these same issues along the length of the MIT 'frontier' in Cambridge, MA as they related to the development of MIT and the biotech research industry.\nIn the fall 2003 Urban Design Studio we propose to focus in on an area adjacent to Cambridgeport and the western end of the MIT campus, roughly centered on Fort Washington. Our goal is to discover the ways in which good urban form, an apt mix of activities, and effective institutional mechanisms might all be brought together in ways that respect shared expectations and reconcile competing expectations - perhaps in unexpected and adroit ways.",

            "description": "In 2005, so-called grid cells have been discovered in the rodent brain. With their activity, grid cells express a remarkably regular metric tessellation of a flat surface - a triangular grid. Their spiking activity is concentrated when the animal is at the nodes of an imaginary grid, different from neuron to neuron. Later found also in crawling bats, it is not clear yet whether in flying bats grid units will provide a regular 3D tiling - such as a face-cubic-centered or hexagonal-close-packed arrangement. Most computational models of this phenomenon are based on various forms of wiring instructions, whereas we have been analyzing a model that demonstrates how grid units can spontaneously self-organize during animal development. Our model predicts that if rats are raised in a cage with non-flat geometry, such as a ball or a hyperbolic surface of negative curvature, grid units will express a non-Euclidean regular tiling, with firing rate peaks that have e.g. 5 or 7 nearest neighbors instead of the Euclidean 6 so far observed with flat cages. Experiments are underway to test this prediction.",

Ancient societies had a vastly different food environment compared to modern day societies, which was characterized by unpredictable food supply, the threat of starvation, and a high priority to bank energy. The human brain evolved for this ancient food environment, which creates challenges in the modern food environment where people have unfettered access to the high sugar, high fat, high variety foods that they are programmed to find appealing.\r\n\r\nReading assignment:\r\n\r\nBrownell, Kelly D. and Katherine B.

            "description": "In addition to cultural controls acting to maximize fertility, there are important, and often competing, interests of individual families to limit fertility. Unwanted births are dealt with by infanticide in many cultures. Additionally, fertility is regularly controlled by limiting marriage within a culture. Another very important factor in population growth, especially in the tropics, is food availability. Heavy rains in the tropics wash nutrients away, leaving deficient soils. Much of Africa is either too dry or too wet. Africa was, until recently, not densely populated. Since land was available and because more children meant more security and power, a culture evolved that emphasized high fertility, justified by the need for descendants to pacify ancestors. Sub-Saharan (tropical) Africa has the highest birth rates in the world. As an example, Niger, just south of the Sahara desert has a fertility rate of almost eight children per woman while, in the Mediterranean zone, Morocco, just north of the Sahara, but also a Sunni Muslim country, has a rate of only 3.3 children per woman.\r\n\r\nReading assignment:\r\n\r\nCaldwell, Pat and John Caldwell. \"High Fertility in Sub-Saharan Africa.\" Scientific American (May 1990), pp. 118-125\r\n\r\nBoserup, Ester.

            "description": "Hunter-gatherer populations were much less dense than later agriculturalists. The variety of their food supply protected them from crop failures and their sparseness reduced the spread of infectious diseases. Hunter-gatherers were healthier and worked less than early agriculturalists. Why didn't their numbers increase up to the same level of Malthusian misery? Their numbers may have been limited by violence between groups. Agriculture is more work intense and offers a less varied diet. Populations seem to grow rapidly and then die out suddenly. Populations are subject to climatic- or disease-caused crop failure. But farming allows individuals to produce a surplus of food that can then be stolen by warrior tribes or military castes. The surplus allows for population growth, cities and stratified societies. The death rate, until perhaps the 1700s in Europe, is enormously high: only approximately a third of women survive to the end of their reproductive period. At this death rate, surviving women who are able to reproduce must have more than six children on average or the society goes extinct. All the great religions and cultures develop in this long period and all stress the requirement for high reproductive rates: \"Be fruitful and multiply.\"\r\n\r\nReading assignment:\r\n\r\nHurtado, A.

It treats buildings and environments, including cities, in the context of the cultural and civilizational history. It offers an introduction to design principles and analysis. Being global, it aims to give the student perspective on the larger pushes and pulls that influence architecture and its meanings, whether these be economic, political, religious or climatic.",

Now, the turn not just of a century but of a millennium having recently passed, such scrutiny and speculations inevitably intensify. What will the future that awaits us in this twenty-first century and beyond be like? And how do visions of that future reflect and respond to the world we live in now? In this course we will read and write about how some writers and filmmakers have responded to the present as a way of imagining&mdash;and warning about&mdash;possible worlds to come. Guided by our reading and discussion, we will scrutinize our own present and construct our own visions of the future through close readings of the texts as well as of some aspects of contemporary culture&mdash;urban and environmental crises, economic imperialism, sexual and reproductive politics, the ethics of biotechnologies, issues of race and gender, the romance of technology, robotics and cyborg cultures, media saturation, language and representation&mdash;and the persistent questions they pose about what it means to be human at this start of a new millennium.",

To enhance discussion, three debates will be held in class. Each student will be required to participate in one of these debates. Each student will also be required to write three short papers. Class participation is essential and will be factored into the final grade.The course will portray the history of theory neither as the history of architectural theory exclusively, nor as a series of prepackaged static pronouncements, but as part of a broader set of issues with an active history that must be continually probed and queried. The sequence of topics will not be absolutely predetermined, but some of the primary issues that will be addressed are: pedagogy, professionalism, nature, modernity and the Enlightenment. Classroom discussions and debates are intended to demonstrate differences of opinion and enhance awareness of the consequences that these differences had in specific historical contexts.",

To the expected audience of PhD students the tasks, methods and techniques used in composing the full language processing pipelines will be presented. These pipelines cover not only language processing at the basic levels (sentence splitting, tokenization, POS/MSD-tagging), but also higher levels (NERC, syntactic parsing, semantic parsing, sematic role labelling, etc.). The lecture will cover not only theoretical concepts needed to understand these methods and tools, but also a practical demonstration of pipelines developed in some EU-funded projects.",

The corpus consists of the transcription of Latvian parliamentary debates from 1993 until 2017, containing 38 million tokens from 468 speakers. Current comparative research of parliamentary debate is not sufficiently facilitated by simply providing unannotated corpora and results mostly in monolingual research by local researchers. We propose that augmenting such corpora with extra layers according to commonly used multilingual standards would make it easier to compare and contrast multiple corpora in different languages. In this regard, we believe that the key factors that need to be added are identifiers of entities mentioned in each utterance, and morphosyntactic information for linguistic analysis. For these reasons, the provided corpus is augmented with named entity linking to the Wikidata knowledge base (provided as linked data), automated translations to English, and morphological and syntactic annotations in Universal Dependency format.",

The META-NET distribution and Language Technology sharing platform META-SHARE provides the access to many ready-made black-box modules for NLP in many languages. These could be used and combined in AI pipelines that process other types of information (e.g. knowledge, vision, reasoning etc.) and still need or rely on input from NLP.

To the expected audience of PhD students the tasks, methods and techniques used in composing the full language processing pipelines will be presented. These pipelines cover not only language processing at the basic levels (sentence splitting, tokenization, POS/MSD-tagging), but also higher levels (NERC, syntactic parsing, semantic parsing, sematic role labelling, etc.). The lecture will cover not only theoretical concepts needed to understand these methods and tools, but also a practical demonstration of pipelines developed in some EU-funded projects.\r\n",

The novel instruments of credit, debt, and investment fashioned during this period proved to be enduring sources of financial innovation, but they also generated a great deal of political conflict, particularly during the revolutionary era itself. &nbsp;This seminar examines the debates surrounding large-scale financial and trading corporations and considers the eighteenth century as a period of recurring financial crisis in which corporate power came into sustained and direct contact with emerging republican norms.  The seminar ends with a look at the relationship between slavery and the rise of &ldquo;modern&rdquo; or &ldquo;industrial&rdquo; capitalism in the nineteenth century, as well as some of the critiques of capitalism that emerged out of that experience.&nbsp;",

            "description": "Touring exhibition Le Corbusier, first exhibition of a foreign architect in Yugoslavia after the Second\r\nWorld War, took place in five out of six capitals of Yugoslavian republics, Split, and Mostar, in the late\r\n1952 and first half of 1953. It was one of a series of cultural events and professional exchanges with\r\nWest that marked the first half of the 1950's. After a representative exhibition of Yugoslavian architecture\r\nin Rabat organised on the occasion of joining International Union of Architects (UIA), opportunity to sum\r\nup achievements of the first five-year plan and proof of existence of modernist discourse inherited from\r\ninterwar period, Le Corbusier's exhibition was supposed to indicate the direction of further development\r\nof urban planning and architecture liberated from classical International style spatial organisation and\r\ndesign. The exhibition was a dialogue initiated by Le Corbusier himself, a platform of topics and designs\r\nimportant for solving acute omnipresent problems – reconstruction and construction of cities, and\r\nhousing. By organising the exhibition after the short-lived episode of Soviet socialist realism Federal\r\nUnion of Associations of Yugoslav Architects confirmed its commitment to modernism as an official\r\narchitectural style of socialist Yugoslavia and Le Corbusier’s position of a leading foreign architect whose\r\nname was synonymous with Neues Bauen already in 1920’s. The leading Yugoslavian architects,\r\nnamely Nikola Dobrović, Juraj Neidhardt, and Edvard Ravnikar (the latter two worked at Le Corbusier’s\r\nstudio in 1930’s), supported the exhibition as well and contributed to its significance by delivering\r\nkeynote speeches and lectures. The presentation will examine the exhibition’s reception and its\r\nrelevance regarding other professional events of the first half of the 1950’s. By presenting exhibition\r\ncontent and series of comparative examples it will also indicated the scope of architectural and urban\r\nplanning production that it affected. \r\n",

            "description": "ORIC is outwardly rectified, rapidly inactivating anionic current that is activated in hypo-osmotic conditions in the membrane of cytoplasmic droplets obtained from sporangiophore of filamentous fungus Phycomyces blakesleeanus . It shares biophysical properties (rectification and inactivation dynamics, ion selectivity order) and activating stimuli (hypo-osmotic conditions or presence of intracellular GTP under isoosmotic conditions) with volume regulated anionic current (VRAC) present in animals. Since VRAC is ATP regulated channel, we tested if ATP affects ORIC as well. For these purposes patch-clamp experiments in whole-cell configuration with 2mM MgATP in the patch pipette were performed. Inclusion of ATP increased maximal ORIC while strikingly reducing its run-down. Time to full activation of ORIC was longer in the presence of MgATP. Additionally, decrease of Mg +2 to 32μM, with 2mM ATP present, did not affect the activation speed, but ORIC activated to a larger value and plateau of maximal activity was longer compared to 2mM Mg +2 with ATP. This suggests that the intracellular Mg +2 exert an inhibiting effect on ORIC, also similar to the effect of Mg +2 on VRAC. Furthermore, in order to establish if respiration blockers affect ORIC, we tested the efficiency of two respiration blockers, antimycin A and azide, on ORIC in concentrations that inhibit cytochrome respiratory pathway completely. Both metabolic blockers inhibited ORIC, thus confirming the ATP is necessary for ORIC activity.\t\r\n\r\nFinancing: Serbian Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development, Grant no. 173040",

        "description": "Graph theory is one of the most applicable fields of mathematics, outside mathematics it is in particular useful in chemistry, molecular biology, bioinformatics and social sciences. The current hot topic of large networks is also based on graph theory. Graph theory is one of the most recognized and established areas of Slovene mathematics, the expression »Slovene graph theory school« became standard in the area. Among the numerous areas of graph theory and related fields we put special emphasize on topological graph theory,  structure graph theory, spectral graph theory, metric graph theory, graph products, graph colorings, graph algorithms, computational geometry, combinatorial optimization, Tower of Hanoi problems as well as applications of these areas. The research group is composed from teams from the University of Ljubljana and the  University of Maribor, each having about one half of the members. The research programme is thus very important as it enables fruitful collaboration between the researchers from both universities. The programme in the present form was established in 2004 by merging the programme Graph products and metric graph theory consisting mostly of researchers from the University of Maribor and the programme Topological graph theory with members from the University of Ljubljana. Our excellence can be proved with top-level publications, numerous invited talks at conferences and universities as well as with our editorial work in central, even prestigious, journals from the area of graph theory and more generally discrete mathematics. Another important achievement are four books published by leading scientific publishers. The first two, »Product graphs: Structure and Recognition«, published in 2000 by Wiley-Interscience and »Graphs on Surfaces« from 2001, published by Johns Hopkins University Press, are among the most cited works of Slovenian mathematics. They were follows with two more books published in 2008 and 2011 with A K Peters and CRC Press, respectively. ",

Tudi izjemno aktualna teorija velikih omrežij temelji na teoriji grafov. Gre za eno izmed najbolj prepoznavnih in v svetu uveljavljenih področij slovenske matematike, v skupnosti se je uveljavil izraz »Slovenska šola teorije grafov.«  Področja teorije grafov in povezanih področij, ki jih programska skupina še posebno razvija, so topološka teorija grafov, strukturna teorija grafov, spektralna teorija grafov, metrična teorija grafov, grafovski produkti, barvanja grafov, algoritmi na grafih, računska geometrija, kombinatorična optimizacija, problemi Hanojskega stolpa ter aplikacije naštetih področij.\r\n\r\n\tSkupino sestavljajo raziskovalci z Univerze v Ljubljani in Univerze v Mariboru, z vsake od teh dveh univerz je v skupini približno polovica članov. Zato je izjemno pomemben združevalni učinek skupine, ki omogoča plodno sodelovanje med raziskovalci z obeh univerz. Skupina v sedanji sestavi je nastala leta 2004 in sicer z združitvijo »mariborske« programske skupine Grafovski produkti in metrična teorija grafov  ter »ljubljanske« programske skupine Topološka teorija grafov.\r\n\r\n\tSvojo odličnost dokazujemo z vrhunskimi objavami, številnimi vabljenimi predavanji na mednarodnih konferencah in univerzah ter z delom v uredniških odborih osrednjih, tudi prestižnih, revij s področja teorije grafov in širše iz diskretne matematike. Še en vidik našega odmevnega delovanja so štiri znanstvene monografije objavljene pri vodilnih svetovnih znanstvenih založnikih. Prvi dve, Product graphs: Structure and Recognition, ki je leta 2000 izšla pri Wiley-Interscience  ter Graphs on Surfaces iz leta 2001 pri Johns Hopkins University Press, sodita med najbolj odmevna dela slovenske matematike, v letu 2008 in 2011 sta se jima pridružila še dva naslova pri A K Peters in CRC Press. \r\n",

The research work will try to situate the conceptual transformation in postmodern philosophical thought and the rise of the new problematic within the wider frame of philosophical, scientific, epistemological, cultural, as well as politico-economic processes in the contemporary world, including Slovenia. The aim of the research work is to elaborate an answer to the question whether and in what way, under the conditions of a globalized world, philosophy as a field of pure thought is still possible today. Special emphasis will be placed on: the conceptual and methodological connections of postmodern philosophy with contemporary social and human sciences, particularly the conditions and results of the encounter with the psychoanalysis of Freud and Lacan, as well as with linguistics, epistemology, jurisprudence, history and anthropology; an analysis of separating the problematics of subject and subjectivization in postmodern philosophy (Badiou, Lyotard, Foucault, Negri, Agamben, Derrida, Habermas, etc.); rethinking of the status of ethics and of ethical discourses in philosophy and the connection of philosophy with the contemporary sciences; a new consideration of the political as a consequence of the breakdown of classic notions of universality, of the social link and of community; rethinking new technologies, cyberspace and the virtualization of space itself; a critical reconsideration of vitalistic and neo-darwinist currents in contemporary philosophy, biophilosophy and biotechnology, ethology, new conceptions of body and life, etc.\r\n#An inquiry into the philosophically relevant history of political thought and research on the history of the philosophical and scientific formation of the modern world. In investigating the history of political thought, special emphasis will be placed on the conceptualization of power in the tradition of Western thought, the articulation of the concept of state and hitherto poorly investigated connections between sovereignty, religion, and the rise of trade, economy, and world war. A particular part of the research work consists of the deconstruction of historiographic revisions of the memory of the Nazi and fascist occupation of Slovenia (1941-45), the partisan resistance movement, collaboration activities and post-war mass killings, and an analysis of the interpretation of history as trauma. The aim of the research work is to contribute to a clarification of various problems: historical memory and historical trauma, civil and religious war, the formation of a political space and the rise of representative democracy, European colonial and society-forming projects, and the formation of an interstate system and supranational identities (Empire, Europe). The basic departure point for the investigation of the philosophical and scientific history of the formation of the modern world will be that philosophical and purely scientific viewpoints regarding this process are inseparable, and that medieval philosophy presents an intersection point of the ancient episteme and modern philosophy. Within this framework, special emphasis will be placed on the relationship between philosophy, theology, and science on one hand, and the epistemological, philosophical, and scientific transformations of the high medieval age, renaissance, and early modern age, on the other. The aim of the scientific research work is to expose those epistemological elements which separate modern from pre-modern philosophy and science.\r\n#An investigation of philosophical aesthetics and the philosophical problematic of visuality",

            "description": "For a training dataset with a nonexhaustive list of classes, i.e. some classes are not yet known and hence are not represented, the resulting learning problem is ill-defined. In this case a sample from a missing class is incorrectly classified to one of the existing classes. For some applications the cost of misclassifying a sample could be negligible. However, the significance of this problem can better be acknowledged when the potentially undesirable consequences of incorrectly classifying a food pathogen as a nonpathogen are considered. Our research is directed towards the real-time detection of food pathogens using optical-scattering technology. Bacterial colonies consisting of the progeny of a single parent cell scatter light at 635 nm to produce unique forward-scatter signatures. These spectral signatures contain descriptive characteristics of bacterial colonies, which can be used to identify bacteria cultures in real time. One bottleneck that remains to be addressed is the nonexhaustive nature of the training library. It is very difficult if not impractical to collect samples from all possible bacteria colonies and construct a digital library with an exhaustive set of scatter signatures. This study deals with the real-time detection of samples from a missing class and the associated problem of learning with a nonexhaustive training dataset. Our proposed method assumes a common prior for the set of all classes, known and missing. The parameters of the prior are estimated from the samples of the known classes. This prior is then used to generate a large number of samples to simulate the space of missing classes. Finally a Bayesian maximum likelihood classifier is implemented using samples from real as well as simulated classes. Experiments performed with samples collected for 28 bacteria subclasses favor the proposed approach over the state of the art.\r\n",

The careful reading and discussion of plays by (Sir) Tom Stoppard and some of his most compelling contemporaries (including Caryl Churchill, Anna Deveare Smith and Howard Barker) will allow us to time-travel and explore other cultures, and to think about the medium of drama as well as one writer's work in depth. Some seminar participants will report on earlier plays that influenced these writers, others will research everything from Lord Byron's poetry to the bridges of Konigsberg, from Dadaism to Charter 77. Employing a variety of critical approaches (both theoretical and theatrical), we will consider what postmodernity means, as applied to these plays. In the process, we will analyze how drama connects with both the culture it represents and that which it addresses in performance. We will also explore the wit and verbal energy of these contemporary dramatists&hellip;not to mention, how Fermat's theorem, classical translation, and chaos theory become the stuff of stage comedy.",

In some ways it simulates traditional field methods research. In terms of format, we work in both group and individual meetings with the consultant. Each student identifies some grammatical construction (e.g. wh questions, agreement, palatalization, interrogative intonation) to focus their research: they elicit and share data and write a report on the material gathered that is to be turned in at the end of the term. Ideally, we can put together a volume of grammatical sketches.\nThe first three to four weeks of the term, our group meetings will explore the basic phonology, morphology and surface syntax for a first pass overview of the language, looking for interesting areas to be explored in more detail later. During this period individual sessions can review material from the general session as well as explore new areas. At roughly the fifth meeting, individual students (typically two to three per session) guide the group elicitations to explore their research topic.",

            "title": "NBC’s Heroes: Appointment TV to Engagement TV",
            "description": "Two progenitors of broadcast TV’s rapid expansion into the digital world provide narrative and back story for the development of NBC’s crossover series, Heroes.\r\n\r\nAs moderator Henry Jenkins notes, in the last few years, there’s been a fundamental shift in the habits of TV viewers, from watching shows broadcast at a specific time, to consuming those shows and related content through a variety of media at any time of day. Jesse Alexander helped usher in this transformation. He says Heroes was “conceived to take advantage of every possible media platform to tell stories, to make the brand viable and important in the world.” Nowadays, to generate such “AAA franchise content,” creators must incorporate “transmedia into the DNA of (their) concept.” With Heroes, this has meant spinning off DVDs, greeting cards, comic books and webisodes with distinct narrative threads, and providing spaces online where core enthusiasts can opine on plot and character.\r\n\r\nThe networks have recently jumped on the transmedia bandwagon, after watching fans, especially the youth demographic advertisers covet, flock to websites dedicated to serialized shows like on Heroes. “NBC used to say, just do a promo,” says Mark Warshaw. But now, eager to wring profit from this phenomenon, NBC has set up a department to develop the series’ online presence and other ancillary features. Network involvement in transmedia has pros and cons. “They’re applying the same production standards to transmedia as to a $120 million dollar series. We need to move at the speed of the Internet, but they’re moving at the speed of network TV.” Warshaw, who’s responsible in large part for originating these non-broadcast features, cleaves close to the series “bible” while creating “a network of channels for every kind of Heroes fan.” Certain minor broadcast characters play central roles in webisodes, and are “used online to plant the seeds for future developments in the TV program.”\r\n\r\nBecause the series is available online (via both legal and illegal downloads), Warshaw reports with delight that Heroes is “a huge international hit.” Before the program appeared in France, producers arranged a pre-broadcast event, and drew an audience that filled the largest theater in Europe. Show creators are trying to tap that global excitement and “create an anthology show based on heroes from around the world, in different time periods.” Ultimately, Alexander and Warshaw hope to plumb the deep emotions and interests of a widespread fan community, and somehow “glean the most important information” from them to help shape offline and online content in a broad sense. Look for a mobile game and a novel down the road, but don’t expect crass merchandising, say these panelists. Alexander notes, “As soon as a brand looks like it’s selling out, it can crash and burn. With all the new potential revenue from internet and ancillary exploitation, there has to be oversight by our team to make sure it has the Heroes stamp of approval.”",

These new media literacies include the practices and concepts of: fan fiction writing, online social networking, videogaming, appropriation and remixing, transmedia navigation, multitasking, performance, distributed cognition, and collective intelligence. Assignments include weekly reading and writing assignments and an original research project. Readings will include Plato, Goody and Watt, Scribner and Cole, Graff, Brandt, Heath, Lemke, Gee, Alvermann, Jenkins, Hobbs, Pratt, Leander, Dyson, Levy, Kress, and Lankshear and Knobel.",

            "title": "Knowledge Extraction from Aerodynamic Design Data and its Application to 3D Turbine Blade Geometries",
            "description": "Applying numerical optimisation methods in the field of aerodynamic design optimisation normally leads to a huge amount of heterogeneous design data. While often only the most promising results are investigated and used to drive further optimisations, general methods for investigating the entire design data set are rare. It is our target to extract comprehensive knowledge from the design data concerning the interrelation between the shape and the performance of the design. The extracted knowledge is prepared in a way that it is usable for guiding further computational as well as manual design and optimisation processes.\r\n   For the design of complex aerodynamic shapes it is common to use different kinds of representations, what makes it difficult or even impossible to analyse the entire design data set. We suggest the transformation of the design data into discrete unstructured surface meshes and hence result in a homogeneous parametrisation of the designs. This makes it possible to analyse the design data independent of the representation used during the design and optimization process.\r\n   On the basis of discrete unstructured surface meshes we propose a displacement measure in order to analyse local differences between designs1. The measure provides information on the amount and the direction of surface modifications. We recently introduced a framework2 that uses the displacement data in conjunction with statistical methods and techniques from machine learning to provide meaningful knowledge from the dataset at hand. The framework comprises a number of approaches for the displacement analysis, sensitivity analysis, dimensionality reduction and rule extraction.\r\n   In order to demonstrate the feasibility of the suggested framework, we applied the proposed methods to a data set of a ultra-low aspect ratio transonic turbine stator blade of a small Honda turbofan engine that resulted from a computational optimisation run3. Decision trees have been formulated to generate a set of design rules which refer to a pre-defined blade design.\r\n   The results have been verified by means of modifying the turbine blade geometry using direct manipulation of free form deformation (DMFFD)4 techniques. The performance of the deformed blade design has been calculated by running computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations. It is shown that the suggested framework provides reasonable results which can directly be transformed into design modifications in order to guide the design process.",

Our goal is to facilitate the annotation process in crowdsourcing map initiatives such as OpenStreetMap, so that more accurate annotations are produced for the newly created spatial entities, while at the same time increasing the reuse of already existing tags. We define and construct a set of training features to represent the attributes of the spatiotextual entities and to capture their relation with the categories they are annotated with. These features include spatial, textual and semantic properties of the entities. We evaluate four different approaches, namely SVM, kNN, clustering+SVM and clustering+kNN, on several combinations of the defined training features and we examine which configurations of the algorithms achieve the best results. The presented work is deployed in OSMRec, a plugin for the JOSM tool that is commonly used for editing content in OpenStreetMap.",

            "description": "Ontology alignment is an area of active research where many algorithms and approaches are being developed. Their performance is usually evaluated by comparing the produced alignments to a reference alignment in terms of precision, recall and F-measure. These measures, however, only provide an overall assessment of the quality of the alignments, but do not reveal differences and commonalities between alignments at a finer-grained level such as, e.g., regions or individual mappings. Furthermore, reference alignments are often unavailable, which makes the comparative exploration of alignments at different levels of granularity even more important. Making such comparisons efficient calls for a 'human-in-the-loop' approach, best supported through interactive visual representations of alignments. Our approach extends a recent tool, Matrix Cubes, used for visualizing dense dynamic networks. We first identify use cases for ontology alignment evaluation that can benefit from interactive visualization, and then detail how our Alignment Cubes support interactive exploration of multiple ontology alignments. We demonstrate the usefulness of Alignment Cubes by describing visual exploration scenarios, showing how Alignment Cubes support common tasks identified in the use cases.",

            "description": "Linked Open Data browsers nowadays usually list facts about entities, but they typically do not respect the relatedness of those facts. At the same time, query logs from LOD datasets hold information about\r\nwhich  facts  are  typically  queried  in  conjunction,  and  should  thus  provide  a  notion  of   intra-fact  relatedness.  In  this  paper,  we  examine  the hypothesis how query logs can be used to improve the display of information from DBpedia, by grouping presumably related facts together. The  basic  assumption  is  that  properties  which  frequently  co-occur  in SPARQL  queries  are  highly  semantically  related,  so  that  co-occurence in query logs can be used for visual grouping of statements in a Linked Data  browser.  A  user  study,  however,  shows  that  the  grouped  display\r\nis not significantly better than simple baselines, such as the alphabetical  ordering  used  by  the  standard  DBpedia  Linked  Data  interface.  A deeper analysis shows that the basic assumption can be proven wrong, i.e., co-occurrence in query logs is actually not a good proxy for semantic relatedness of statements",

            "description": "With the advent of publicly available geospatial data, ontology-based data access (OBDA) over spatial data has gained increasing interest. Spatiorelational DBMSs are used to implement geographic information systems (GIS) and are fit to manage large amounts of data and geographic objects such as points, lines, polygons, etc. In this paper, we extend the Description Logic DL-Lite with spatial objects and show how to answer spatial conjunctive queries (SCQs) over ontologies—that is, conjunctive queries with point-set topological relations such as next and within\r\n—expressed in this language. The goal of this extension is to enable an off-the-shelf use of spatio-relational DBMSs to answer SCQs using rewriting techniques, where data sources and geographic objects are stored in a database and spatial conjunctive queries are rewritten to SQL statements with spatial functions. Furthermore, we consider keyword-based querying over spatial OBDA data\r\nsources, and show how to map queries expressed as simple keyword lists describing objects of interest to SCQs, using a meta-model for completing the SCQs with spatial aspects. We have implemented our lightweight approach to spatial OBDA in a prototype and show initial experimental results using data sources such as Open Street Maps and Open Government Data Vienna from an associated project. We show that for real-world scenarios, practical queries are expressible under\r\nmeta-model completion, and that query answering is computationally feasible. ",

In particular, it is useful to know quickly if two ontologies are close or remote before deciding to match them. To that extent, a distance between ontologies must be quickly computable. We present constraints applying to such measures\r\nand several possible ontology distances. Then we evaluate experimentally some of them in order to assess their accuracy and speed.",

            "description": "Observational studies in the literature have highlighted low levels of\r\nuser satisfaction in relation to the support for ontology visualization and\r\nexploration provided by current ontology engineering tools. These issues are\r\nparticularly problematic for non-expert users, who rely on effective tool support\r\nto abstract from representational details and to be able to make sense of the\r\ncontents and the structure of ontologies. To address these issues, we have\r\ndeveloped a novel solution for visualizing and navigating ontologies, KC-Viz,\r\nwhich exploits an empirically-validated ontology summarization method, both\r\nto provide concise views of large ontologies, and also to support a ‘middle-out’\r\nontology navigation approach, starting from the most information-rich nodes\r\n(key concepts). In this paper we present the main features of KC-Viz and also\r\ndiscuss the encouraging results derived from a preliminary empirical\r\nevaluation, which suggest that the use of KC-Viz provides performance\r\nadvantages to users tackling realistic browsing and visualization tasks.\r\nSupplementary data gathered through questionnaires also convey additional\r\ninteresting findings, including evidence that prior experience in ontology\r\nengineering affects not just objective performance in ontology engineering\r\ntasks but also subjective views on the usability of ontology engineering tools.",
